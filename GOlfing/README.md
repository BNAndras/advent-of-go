# (Code) GO-lfing

This sub-folder contains attempts of me [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf)-ing my solutions for Advent of Code 2020.

I know this folder is named **GO**lfing, but I will try this with **Javascript**. Just a fun little sidequest...  
I don't know for how long this keeps on, I'm just trying to have fun doing this :)

Don't expect them to be the shortest possible source-codes for the problems.
